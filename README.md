[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)  
Welcome to my repository showcasing the use of [**Kusto Query Language (KQL)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/?view=microsoft-fabric) as GQL for advanced financial data analysis. This project demonstrates how graph-driven queries can uncover hidden patterns and relationships in financial datasets.

## 🎯 Objective

The graphical presentations in this repository address key financial intelligence use cases:

- 💸 **Financial Fraud Detection**
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Analysis**
- 🔁 **Transaction Pattern Analysis**
- 📊 **Risk Assessment & Credit Scoring**
- 🚨 **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**
- 🌐 **Financial Network Analysis**

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo contains three sub-folders, each representing a distinct relationship model:

- 🧾 `AccountOwnerships/`  
  *Graph of account ownerships by individuals and companies.*

- 🔄 `Transactions/`  
  *Graph of transactions among individuals and companies.*

- ⏱️ `TimelinedTransactions/`  
  *Time-pivoted chart of individual-to-individual transactions.*
